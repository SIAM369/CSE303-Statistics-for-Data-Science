This sentence was stored by Python as a string. However, instead of immediately printing strings out, we will explore the various things you can do to them. You can also use single quotes to assign a string. However, you will face problems if the value to be assigned itself contains single quotes. For example to assign the string in these bracket(single quotes are ' ') you need to use double quotes only like this:"],"metadata":{"id":"KMYA33JGbtFw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["astring = \"Hello world!\"\n","print(\"single quotes are ' '\")\n","\n","print(len(astring))"],"metadata":{"id":"CZnjkrypbubM","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1665910089705,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":380,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammad Hasan Azhar","userId":"10792961453266478407"}},"outputId":"a46cfc31-7396-406f-85c1-e650a1b7e7be"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["single quotes are ' '\n","12\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Lets work with some more string methods"],"metadata":{"id":"7pap_BlKcCep"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["astring = \"Hello world!\"\n","print(astring.index(\"o\"))"],"metadata":{"id":"MQrXjdsVcGNc","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667373453487,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":608,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammad Hasan Azhar","userId":"10792961453266478407"}},"outputId":"1de447ba-41e1-4fed-e455-40500bc88d71"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["4\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["That prints out 4, because the location of the first occurrence of the letter \"o\" is 4 characters away from the first character.
